\section{GLE Installation on a PC}
\index{DOS}
To install GLE, put the distribution disk into drive a: and
type:
\begin{verbatim}
     a:install
\end{verbatim}

GLE requires at least 800K of disk space for a minimal installation
and 3.3M for a full installation (including all device drivers
and fonts).

GLE also requires 530K or more of free memory. Use the DOS
command CHKDSK to check this figure. If you don't have
enough then take copies of your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
and then remove as much as possible from these files.

GLE may work with less memory depending on what you are drawing.

The installation disk contains a version of CGLE which will
make use of epanded memory.  This version can run with 70K less
memory but if you don't have expanded memory then it has to
use your hard disk instead which is a great deal slower.

\index{EPS}
\index{Encapsulated PostScript}
To produce an .eps file for inclusion in WordPerfect you would type:
\begin{verbatim}
     C:> psgle myfile /eps
\end{verbatim}
This will create a file called myfile.EPS.

WordPerfect can also understand a special file format which contains
both an EPS file for printing to PostScript printers and a bitmap  TIFF
image for displaying on the screen.  GLE can create this sort of
file with the command:
\begin{verbatim}
     C:> wpgle myfile
\end{verbatim}
This will create a file called MYFILE.EPF which you can include into
WordPerfect.

If your PC is connected to a VAX computer which has a PostScript printer
you may copy MYFILE.PS to the VAX using a standard file transfer
program (e.g. FTP, KERMIT, VDISK)

The best way to see what GLE can do is to have a play with it, simply
start it up and try out some of the examples:
\begin{verbatim}
     Press F3       (Load file)
     Press <enter>  (for a menu of GLE files)
     Use arrow keys to select example, then press <enter>
     Press F10 to draw the picture
     Press ESC to get back to the GLE editor.
     ...
     When you find a graph try pressing F9 and modifying
     one of the fields (use F1 for an explanation of each
     field).
\end{verbatim}

Used symbols for PC:
\begin{verbatim}
GLE_NOCONTROLD TRUE  (Stops ^D being added to ps files)
(this is the default for unix)

GLE_ADDBGI ...       (high resolution BGI-Driver)
(see Device Drivers)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Running GLE on a VAX}
\index{VAX}
The command to run GLE is:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ cgle myfile.gle
     $ cgle myfile.gle /dev=regis
     $ cgle myfile.gle /dev=x
\end{verbatim}
See the directory CGLE\_EXAMPLES: for examples and templates.
To get access to these files from the GLE menus use the commands:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ define workarea sys$login:,cgle_examples:
     $ set default workarea:
     $ cgle stack4b.gle      ! or any other example
\end{verbatim}

If your keyboard doesn't have the function keys F9 thru F14 you can
use GOLD (PF1) followed by the numbers 9,0,1,2,3,4 (on the top of the
QWERTYUIOP keypad).

Keyboard Mappings:\\

Supported output: PostScript, HPGL, Epson, Epson 24pin, HP Deskjet.

\index{printing}
To create a PostScript output file (.PS) and automatically print it to
the LASER queue you would type:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ cgle myfile /print
\end{verbatim}

\index{EPS}
\index{Encapsulated PostScript}
To produce an .eps file for inclusion in \LaTeX\ you would type:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ cgle myfile /dev=eps
\end{verbatim}

To produce a .ps file suitable for printing to a laser writer type:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ cgle myfile /dev=ps
\end{verbatim}

The DCL symbol GLE\_NOCONTROLD should be set to "TRUE" to kill the
\verb#^D# on vms systems.

If you set the DCL symbol GLE\_EDITOR to TPU then you will get
TPU instead of EDT when you press \verb#^E#.

\section{It didn't work, bugs!!!}
\index{bugs} \index{errors}
If the installation fails, or one of the example GLE files fails to work
then the most likely reason is a shortage of memory due to too many
memory resident programs/drivers.  To fix this remove these utilities from
your autoexec.bat and config.sys files temporarily.

There may well be a bug in your GLE file,  try using the
trace option to find the bug.\\
On a PC:
\begin{verbatim}
     C:\GLE> psgle myfile /trace
\end{verbatim}

On a VAX:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ cgle myfile /dev=ps /trace
\end{verbatim}

Another reason for a failure is a bug in GLE,  {\bf Please} report
bugs to Chris Pugmire (Internet srghcxp@grv.dsir.govt.nz,  grv::srghcxp)
so they can be fixed. If possible, try and find a way of
repeating the problem, then send relevant GLE and data files with
an outline of what is wrong.

\subsection{PC Screen Drivers}
\index{PC screen driver}
\index{Device Drivers!PC screen driver}
Remember that what you see on the screen isn't always what you will
get on the printer.  For example filled regions will not be filled,
and some characters may not look right.

After pressing F10 and drawing the graph it can be annotated by using 
the mouse (or arrow keys) to draw lines, text and boxes.  
To draw lines simply click on the points of the line, use the right
hand mouse button to `pick up' the pen.  

To draw text press the letter `t' and then click on where you would
like the text to be drawn.  

All movements are rounded to the grid size settings which are 
1.0cm, 0.1cm, 0.01cm etc.  

The height and colour of the text/lines is determined by the current
settings at the end of the GLE file.

If there is no mouse driver loaded then a cross-hair will appear 
and it can be moved around using the arrow keys.  Press `c' to 
click, instead of the mouse button.

\subsubsection{SuperVGA}
\index{Device Drivers!PC SVGA}
%
To use a SuperVGA card you first need to get a BGI
driver that supports your card.  From anonymous FTP
you can get svgabgi3.zip: ftp wuarchive.wustl.edu
\begin{verbatim}
     ftp> user anonymous
     ftp> (mail ident)
     ftp> cd /mirrors/msdos/borland
     ftp> binary
     ftp> get svgabgi3.zip
     ftp> quit
\end{verbatim}
Then unzip it, decide which driver will match your SVGA card
and copy that driver into \verb?\GLE\EXE?.
\begin{verbatim}
     c:> pkunzip svgabgi3.zip
     c:> pkunzip svgabgi3.zip
     c:> type readme. 
     c:> copy svga16.bgi \gle\exe
\end{verbatim}
Define an environment variable to tell gle about this driver
and which mode to use. (put this line in your autoexec.bat)
\begin{verbatim} 
     c:> set gle_addbgi=4.svga16
\end{verbatim}

\index{printing}
To print a GLE file to the laser printer type:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ cgle myfile /print
\end{verbatim}

or on a PC:
\begin{verbatim}
     C:\GLE> psgle myfile   
     C:\GLE> print myfile.ps 
\end{verbatim}

\index{flipping}
The postscript drivers for GLE will automatically flip a 
picture to best fit onto the page,  e.g. a wide graph
(as defined by the size command at the top) will be drawn 
in {\em landscape} mode and a tall thin graph will be drawn in
{\em portrait} mode.

\index{EPS}
\index{Device Drivers!PostScript}
\index{PostScript (EPS, WordPerfect)}
\index{Encapsulated PostScript}
\index{WordPerfect}
\index{\LaTeX \ (inserting graphs)}
To produce an .eps file on a VAX for inclusion in \LaTeX \ or 
WordPerfect you would type:
\begin{verbatim}
     $ cgle myfile /dev=eps
\end{verbatim}

On a PC you would type:
\begin{verbatim}
     C:\GLE> psgle myfile  /eps
     (this creates myfile.eps, not myfile.ps)
\end{verbatim}

WordPerfect can also understand a special file format which contains
both an EPS file for printing to PostScript printers and a bitmap  TIFF 
image for displaying on the screen.  GLE can create this sort of 
file with the command:
\begin{verbatim}
     C:> wpgle myfile
\end{verbatim}
This will create a file called MYFILE.EPF which you can include into
WordPerfect.

%Inside your \LaTeX \ document use the \LaTeX \  command:
%\begin{verbatim}
%     \graphin{myfile.eps}{12.0cm}{3.0cm}{1.0}
%\end{verbatim}
% sm
To include Postscript in a \LaTeX \ document use epsf.sty of the 
{\sf DVIPS}-package.  
Inside your \LaTeX \ document use {\sf\\epsffile } to put it at the right
place in a {\sf picture}-environment, e.g. :
\begin{verbatim}
     \documentstyle[12pt,epsf]{article}
     ...
     \begin{picture}(13.0, 5.5)
     \put(0.0,0.0){
     \epsfclipon
     \epsfxsize=6cm
     \epsffile[60 170 560 740]{myfile.ps} } % [ bounding-box ] { file_name }
     \end{picture}
\end{verbatim}
	
Advanced features of {\sf epsf.sty} are described in {\tt
../TeX/src/dvips/dvips.tex}.
% sm

\index{lwidth}
\index{line width}
The laser printer driver will draw all zero width lines .02cm wide
for any line width equal to zero, but if an lwidth 
is greater than zero and less than or equal to .0001 then it will use a line 
width of 1 pixel.  Without this it would be impossible to specify 
a line width that didn't occasionally get rounded to 2 pixels.

There are also some commandline switches
\begin{verbatim}
                /nod       (add ^D to ps file)
                /addd      (Don't add ^D to ps file)
                /nomaxpath (Don't choke on complex fill paths)
                /fill      (For dvibit, makes bar's filled instead of shaded)
\end{verbatim}

\index{Device Drivers!TEK4010}
\subsection{TEK4010 Driver}
This driver allows initialization sequences to be defined 
with the symbols TEK\_OPEN and TEK\_CLOSE.

On a VAX this is normally done by CGLECMD.COM so that when you
specify /DEV=V550 the assignments are done for you.
(V550 = Visual 550)

\index{plotter pens}
\index{pens} \index{HPGL}
\subsection{HPGL Driver}
\index{Device Drivers!HPGL Driver}
This driver allows initialization sequences to be defined 
in the symbols HPGL\_OPEN and HPGL\_CLOSE.  On the PC 
use environment variables and on the VAX use DCL symbols.
Also HPGL\_WIDTH and HPGL\_HEIGHT can be defined for non A3 plotters.

The HPGL driver supports sizes greater than A3.

The symbols HPGL\_ADDX, HPGL\_ADDY add a margin to the plot.  
These default to .9cm and 1.5cm

On a VAX this is normally done by CGLECMD.COM so that when you
specify /DEV=HPA4 the assignments are done for you.

The HPGL driver assigns the following colours to pen numbers:

1=black, 2=red, 3=green, 4=blue, 5=magenta, 6=white, 7=yellow.

To get Gle-Output in a WIN-WORD text, HPGL is a good and easy way to do it.
\index{Win-Word} \index{Win-Word!HPGL-Import}

The use of the HPGL-Converter HP2XX of Heinz W. Werntges is another way to
get various pix-map format output. HP2XX has been ported successfully 
for Unix, OS/2, DOS, Amiga, Atari, VMS and AXP. \\ 
HP2XX has many controling options. In
the current version it is able to write the following formats: 
mf, cad, em, epic, eps, pcl, pcx, pic, img, pbm, pre, uis.

HP2XX is available via anonymous FTP at ftp.rz.uni-duesseldorf.de. For

\subsection{PC Bitmap Drivers}
\index{PC Bitmap Driver}
\index{Device Drivers!PC Bitmap Driver}
GLE supports the EPSON 8 and 24 pin and HP deskjet/laserjet printers.
To support bitmap devices which require a large amount of memory GLE 
first writes a device independent file OUT.DVI, then the
appropriate bitmap driver for your printer will read the OUT.DVI file
and create a bitmap which it then prints to LPT1:

\begin{verbatim}
     C:> dvigle myfile      (produces OUT.DVI)
     C:> dviepson           (creates bitmap and prints to LPT1:)
\end{verbatim}

The output options are:
\begin{verbatim}
     C:> dviepson           Standard EPSON printers 
     C:> dviep24            24 Pin EPSON printers (180dpi)
     C:> dvilj              HP Laser jet, Desk jet (150 dpi)
     C:> dvilj300           HP Laser jet, Desk jet (300 dpi)
     C:> dviprint -dpj      HP PaintJet printers
     C:> dviprint -dsx      Sixel graphics driver
\end{verbatim}
The high resolution drivers (dviep24, dvilj300) are significantly slower
than the low resolution drivers so would only be used for final output.

See the file AAREADME.GLE for the latest information on drivers.

\subsection{DVIPRINT}

\subsection{Fonts (font mapping)}
\index{Device Drivers!fonts}
By default the generic fonts (rm, rmb, ss, tt etc) will all map
to PLSR (plotter simplex roman) on BITMAP and HPGL drivers.  To make
this happen on other drivers put the command 
{\sf plotter fonts} immediately after the {\sf size} command 
at the top of the GLE file.

A typical result of this change in fonts is that something 
that lines up on the screen will not line up when printed 
to an EPSON printer.  If this happens then use the {\sf plotter fonts}
command.

If a character is missing from a font, or isn't the particular 
variation you like, you can define a character to be from 
a different font in this way: 
\begin{verbatim}
     \chardef{%}{{\setfont{texcmr}\char{37}}} 
     \chardef{[}{{\setfont{texcmr}\char{91}}} 
     \chardef{]}{{\setfont{texcmr}\char{93}}} 
\end{verbatim}

	On the PC some fonts may not be installed to save disk space.
When one of the missing fonts is  called for, a replacement 
font will be displayed, this may look
terrible and some special characters may be completely wrong.

\clearpage
More importantly if you use a font which does not have its font metric
file installed (e.g. C:/GLE/FONTS/PLSR.FMT) then the
PostScript driver will space the characters incorrectly.  This can 
be fixed by extracting that particular metric file from the 
distribution file CGLE\_FVE.ZIP using PKUNZIP. 

\subsection{Printer Fonts}
\index{Device Printer!fonts}
You can now tell gle about postscript fonts that you have 
downloaded into your own printer.

Lets pretend we are adding a font called Greek-Bold
\begin{verbatim}
                1) Download the font into you laser printer
                2) Add a line to FONT.DAT
psgb 86 psgb.fmt plsr.fve psgb.fmt
a    b  c        d
                a = GLE's name for the font
                b = The next unused number in font.dat
                c = The font metric file, this can be created using
                        makefmt from and adobe font metric file
                        (.afm) which you should have been supplied
                        with your font.
                d = The font vector file, this is just a font that
                        that gle can use to draw your font on non
                        postscript devices.
                3) Add a line to psfont.dat
psgb Greek-Bold
\end{verbatim}
This tells the postscript driver that this is a 
font that the printer knows how to deal with.
