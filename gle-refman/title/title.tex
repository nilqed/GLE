\chapter{Preface}

\section*{Abstract}

GLE (Graphics Layout Engine) is a graphics scripting language designed for creating publication quality figures (e.g., a chart, plot, graph, or diagram). It supports various chart types (including function plot, histogram, bar chart, scatter plot, contour plot, color map, and surface plot) through a simple but flexible set of graphing commands. More complex output can be created by relying on GLE's scripting language, which is full featured with subroutines, variables, and logic control. GLE relies on \LaTeX{} for text output and supports mathematical formulae in graphs and figures. GLE's output formats include EPS, PS, PDF, JPEG, and PNG. GLE is licenced under the BSD license. QGLE, the GLE user interface, is licenced under the GPL license.

\subsection*{Pathways}

For those in a hurry:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item		Read Chapter~\ref{tut:chap}, The GLE Tutorial (beginners only).
 \item		Examine the examples at \url{http://www.gle-graphics.org/examples/}.
 \item		Browse through Chapter~\ref{graph:chap}, The Graph Module.
\end{enumerate}
	
For those with time:
\begin{itemize}	
 \item {\bf Chapter~\ref{tut:chap}, GLE Tutorial:}\\
	Covers installation and drawing a simple graph, highly
	recommended if you have never used GLE before.
 \item {\bf Chapter~\ref{prim:chap}, GLE Primitives:}\\
	Describes the commands used for creating diagrams and slides and for annotating graphs.
 \item {\bf Chapter~\ref{graph:chap}, The Graph Module:}\\
	Describes the commands for drawing graphs.
 \item {\bf Chapter~\ref{key:chap}, The Key Module:}\\
	Describes the commands for producing keys for graphs.
 \item {\bf Chapter~\ref{adv:chap}, Advanced Features of GLE:}\\
	Covers advanced features of GLE. This includes programming constructs,
	the \LaTeX{} interface, $\ldots$
 \item {\bf Chapter~\ref{surf:chap}, Surface and Contour Plots:}\\
	Describes the commands for drawing three-dimensional graphs.
 \item {\bf Chapter~\ref{util:chap}, GLE Utilities:}\\
	Describes FITLS and MANIP.
\end{itemize}
