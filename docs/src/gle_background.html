        I have used version 3.3b of the early 90's vintage for
        many years, in both DOS and UNIX. Regrettably advances in
        software/hardware have made it creak a little, and below
        I originally described some stops in my turn of the
        century quest for the perfect </font><font size="3"
        face="Courier New">gle</font><font size="3">.&nbsp; I've
        found that many of the original links are dead, and have
        tried to update where possible:</font><p><font size="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                can still be found, but you have to search for
                it, as many older repositories of programs are
                dying out/changing.</font></li>

                Axel Rohde as version 3.3h was for a long time
                available from University of Duesseldorf.
                Regrettably I did not manage to get this to work
                satisfactorily, but admittedly I didn't try very
                hard. Successful installation promised a wide

                which works well enough in the win95+ world was
                found by me on the web in the mid 90's and
                combined with the Rohde version. Note that the
                mouse does exist in preview mode, but it is
                activated by pressing the appropriate keyboard
                key for line or text placement. Previewing is
                also limited to standard VGA. This version is now
